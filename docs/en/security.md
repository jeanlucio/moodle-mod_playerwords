# 🔐 Security & Compliance

* Capability-based access control (`mod/playerwords:view`, `mod/playerwords:addinstance`)
* `require_sesskey()` protection on all POST actions; AJAX calls are validated by Moodle's `core/ajax` dispatcher
* Server-side enforcement of round limits and cooldown, always recomputed from current settings
* Round timeout is re-validated against the server's own deadline (with a small network-latency tolerance) instead of trusting the client's countdown alone
* Guess charset validation — only Unicode letters accepted
* AI-generated words are treated as untrusted input: only single-token, alphabetic terms within the configured length bounds are saved, and they enter pending teacher approval
* Session round state is isolated per activity instance and per user — a word id or session key from one activity is never accepted by another
* A wrong guess never leaks the correct word or its definition; the word is only ever revealed once the round has actually finished
* Moodle External API compliant
* Privacy API fully implemented (GDPR/LGPD)

## 🔒 Third-party Service Disclosure

AI word generation is **optional** and disabled by default. When a teacher uses it, the
activity topic (never student data or attempt records) is sent through [AI Hub](#aihub)
(`local_aihub`) — using that user's or the site's own BYOK key, if the plugin is installed — or,
as a fallback, through Moodle's own core AI subsystem (`core_ai`), which routes to whatever
provider the site administrator has configured. PlayerWords never contacts an AI provider
directly; the request and its disclosure/consent are entirely owned by `local_aihub` or by
`core_ai`. If neither is installed or configured, the AI word source is unavailable and every
other feature keeps working normally.

* **Cost:** None required by PlayerWords itself. If used, any cost is whatever the underlying
  provider charges through a `local_aihub` BYOK key, or nothing at all via a free/institutional
  `core_ai` provider the site admin may have already configured.
* **API keys / credentials:** Not configured in PlayerWords. Obtain and configure a personal or
  site key inside [AI Hub](#aihub) (`local_aihub`), or ask the site administrator to
  configure a `core_ai` provider instead.
* **Demo credentials:** Not applicable — no credentials are required to install or use
  PlayerWords; AI generation is entirely opt-in.

## 📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics

PlayerWords periodically sends an anonymous, aggregate usage report to the developer's own
telemetry service, to help prioritise fixes and improvements. This is a separate mechanism
from the AI feature above and does not require it to be configured.

### Is it required?

No. It is **on by default** but fully opt-out: disable it at any time from
**Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > PlayerWords** ("Send anonymous usage
statistics"). Nothing about the activity's own features changes if it is disabled.

### What is sent

A single JSON payload, at most once every 21 days:

- **Site info:** Moodle version/release, PHP version, site country and language, whether the
  site runs a non-vanilla Moodle fork (Totara/IOMAD/Workplace) and its version.
- **Plugin usage:** PlayerWords' own installed version/release, an approximate active-student
  count (students with a round attempt in the last 90 days), how many course instances of the
  activity exist across the site, and whether the companion plugins ([AI Hub](#aihub) and
  PlayerHUD) are installed and their versions.
- **Internal error counters:** aggregate counts of two known-fragile code paths in AI word
  generation — every provider attempt failing, or the AI answering with fewer usable words than
  requested — never the error content itself, only how many times each happened.
- **Site identifier:** Moodle's own anonymous site identifier (`get_site_identifier()`) and
  the site's URL, so repeated reports from the same site can be recognised as one deployment
  over time rather than counted as new installs.

### What is never sent

No student data, no personal data of any user (name, email, ID), no word pool content, no AI
prompts or responses, and no data from courses that do not have the activity added.

### Where reports are sent

Reports are sent to `https://plugintelemetry.duckdns.org/report.php`, a service operated by
the plugin's own developer — not a third-party analytics vendor.

Declared in the plugin's own Privacy Provider (`classes/privacy/provider.php`) as an external
location, per standard Moodle Privacy API practice for any plugin that transmits data off-site.
